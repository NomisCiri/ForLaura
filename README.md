# ForLaura - From Simon

That's a markdown file which you can use to guide you through the repository. 
This one is not really complex so it should be fine.
I thought it might be useful to get started with git once you start coding and hacking these different files.
Git is nice because you can play around with it and always set your code back to the last working stage.

To work with it wothout git however, you can just download the file.
If you wanna use git, you need an own account and instead of dowlnoading you can "clone" this repository on your harddrive.
Then you can "push" changes to the cloud everytime if you work out sth new.
Others can see your changes and work on them themselves.

There are different branches. I pushed the code I had to a "master" brach. If you want to hack, pls work
in a different one - the "development" branch.
If you have questions i am happy to help.

# Files

You find different folders in this repository. 
two of them contain the python scripts you already have.
they run with <strong> PYSCHOPY WHICH RUNS ON PYTHON VERSION 2.7 </strong>.
The others are standalone running Javascrip experiments that you can run via doubleklicking 
<strong> index </strong>. <br>
Deeper Layers are coded with jspsych which is a Javascript Library that I also used for my experiments but 
it is different from the one Lucas used. If you want to run this in the internet you have to upload them on a webserver and connect them
to a database. Best is MySQL.
you can find a good tutourial for this on https://www.jspsych.org/
